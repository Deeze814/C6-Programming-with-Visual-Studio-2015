# C#6 Programming with Visual Studio 2015
Repo holding the exercises from the book.

## Chapter 1: Introducing C# 
### What is the .NET Framework?
<ol>
	<li><b>Mono</b> is an open source version of the .NET Framework (including a C# Compiler) that runs on several operating systems, including various flavors of Linux and Mac OS.
		<ul>
			<li>You can read more about it at http://www.mono-project.com</li>
			<li>There are also variants of Mono that urn on iPhone (MonoTouch) and Android(Mono for Android, aka MonoDroid)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Part of the .NET Framework library defines some basic types, and by specifying fundamental types, the Framework facilitates interoprability between languages using the .NET Framework.
		<ul>
			<li>This is called the <b>Common Type System(CTS)</b></li>
		</ul>		
	</li>
	<li>The .NET Framework also includes the <b>Common Language Runtime(CLR)</b>.
		<ul>
			<li>The CLR is responsible for the execution of all applications developed using the .NET library</li>
		</ul>		
	</li>
</ol>
### Writing Applications Using the .NET Framework
<ol>
	<li>In order for C# code to execute, it must be converted into a langauge that the target operating system understands, known as <b>native code</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>This conversion is called <b>compiling</b> code, an act that is performed by a compiler.</li>
			<li>Under the .NET Framework, this is a two stage process</li>
		</ul>
	<li>When you compile code that uses the .NET Framework library, you don't immediately create operating system specific code.
		<ul>
			<li>Instead you Compile code into <b>Common Intermediate Language(CIL)</b> code
				<ul>
					<li>This code isnt specific to any operating system and isnt specific to C#</li>
					<li>This compilation step is carried out by Visual Studio when you develope C# applications</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>More work is required to execute an application, and that is the job of a <b>just-in-time(JIT)</b> compiler
				<ul>
					<li>The JIT compiles CIL into native code tht is specific to the OS and machine architecture being targeted.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You might come across references to <b>Microsoft Intermediate Language(MSIL)</b> or just IL.
		<ul>
			<li>MSIL was the original name for CIL, and many developers still used this terminology.</li>
			<li><b>MSIL == CIL</b></li>
		</ul>
	</li>	
</ol>
### Assemblies
<ol>
	<li>When you compile and application, the CIL code is stored in an <b>assembly</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Assemblies included both:
				<ul>
					<li>Executable application files that you can run directly on Windows without the need for any programs</li>
					<li>These have a <b>.exe</b> file extension</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Libraries for use by other applications</li>
					<li>These have a <b>.dll</b> extension</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you write code that performs tasks required by multiple applications, you want to place the reusable code in a place accessible by all the applications
		<ul>
			<li>In the .NET Framework, this location is known as the <b>global assembly cache(GAC)</b></li>
			<li>Placing code in the GAC is simple, you just place the assembly containing the code in the directory containing this cache.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>		
</ol>
### Managed Code
<ol>
	<li>Code written using the .NET Framework is <b>managed</b> when it is executed
		<ul>
			<li>A stage usually referred to as <b>runtime</b></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>This means that the CLR looks after your applications by managing memory, handling security, allowing cross-language debugging, and so on</li>
</ol>
### Linking
<ol>
	<li>It is possible to split application code across multiple source code files, which are then compiled together into a single assembly.</li>
	<li>This process is known as <b>linking</b>
		<ul>
			<li>It is required because it is far easier to work with several smaller files than one enormous one</li>
			<li>You can seperate logically related code into an individual file so that it can be worked on independently.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>	
</ol>
